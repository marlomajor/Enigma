*Enigma Program*

Enigma was machine used during World War II to intercept and decipher German encrypted code. The creation of the Enigma machine was a deciding factor in the war, with some saying it reduced the total time in the war by as much as four years.

This project will build a version of the Enigma machine. It will use symmetric encryption that will allow the code to be encrypted/decrypted the same way.
